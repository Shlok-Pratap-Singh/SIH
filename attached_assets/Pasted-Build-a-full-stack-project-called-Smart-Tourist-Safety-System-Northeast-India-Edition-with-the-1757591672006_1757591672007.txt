Build a full-stack project called **Smart Tourist Safety System – Northeast India Edition** with the following requirements:

### 1. Tech Stack
- **Mobile App (Tourist side)** → Flutter (cross-platform Android/iOS).  
- **Web Dashboard (Police/Tourism side)** → React.js.  
- **Backend** → Node.js with Express.js REST API.  
- **Database** → PostgreSQL.  
- **Maps/Geo-fencing** → Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap.  
- **News/Crime Feed** → Use NewsAPI or Google News RSS integration.  
- **Blockchain Simulation** → Use Ethereum testnet or Hyperledger for tamper-proof Digital Tourist ID records. (For MVP, allow mock hashed IDs.)  

---

### 2. Features (Tourist Mobile App)
- **Digital ID Registration**:  
  - Tourist registers with Aadhaar/Passport number (dummy validation for MVP).  
  - Generates a **QR Code ID** valid only for Northeast travel.  

- **Geo-fencing Alerts**:  
  - Restrict map functionality to Northeast India (Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Sikkim).  
  - Alert tourists if they enter restricted/high-risk zones.  

- **Panic Button**:  
  - Sends live GPS + tourist ID to the **nearest police station** and emergency contacts.  

- **Tourist Safety Score**:  
  - Basic rule-based system (e.g., isolated zones at night → lower score).  

- **Live News & Crime Updates**:  
  - Fetch and display recent **accidents, crime reports, or unrest** from local news APIs filtered to Northeast.  

- **Color-Coded Safety Map**:  
  - Define zones with different colors:  
    - Safe → Light Green  
    - Moderate Risk → Yellow  
    - Unsafe/High Risk → Red  
    - Forest/Protected Zone → Dark Green  
    - Border/Restricted → Grey  

- **Multilingual Support**:  
  - English + Hindi + Assamese (expand later to Bengali, Manipuri, Khasi, Mizo, Nagamese).

### 3. Police/Tourism Dashboard (Web)
- Login for **Northeast police & tourism officials**.  
- **Map-based dashboard** with same color-coded scheme as app.  
- Real-time visualization of tourist clusters and alerts.  
- Access to tourist Digital IDs + trip info.  
- Logs of **alerts, missing tourist reports, accident updates**.  
- Ability to **push safety advisories** directly to tourist apps.  

---

### 4. Backend APIs
- `POST /registerTourist` → Register and generate Digital ID (QR code).  
- `POST /updateLocation` → Update tourist GPS coordinates.  
- `POST /panicAlert` → Send panic alert to police + emergency contacts.  
- `GET /getSafetyZones` → Return safety classification of areas.  
- `GET /getNewsUpdates` → Fetch recent crime/accident news for given location.  

---

### 5. Deployment
- Deploy backend on Render/Heroku.  
- Deploy dashboard on Vercel.  
- Mobile app build for Android + iOS using Flutter.  

---

### Notes
- Keep code modular, well-documented, and region-restricted to **Northeast India only**.  
- For MVP, mock blockchain by storing hashed IDs if full blockchain integration is complex.  
- Ensure all communication is secure (JWT auth, HTTPS).
